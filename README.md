# Coverex

Coverex is an Elixir Coverage tool used by `mix`. It provides tables with overviews of
module and function coverage data, includings links to annotated source code files.

## Configuration

Coverex is completely configured via `mix.exs` of your project. To enable `Coverex`,
you add this line to your `mix.exs` file

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: Coverex.Task]
```

as part of the regular project settings. In addition to that, you need to add Coverex
to the dependencies of your project. Coverex is available via `hex.pm`, so you need only to
add this line to the dependencies in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
{:coverex, "~> 1.4.10", only: :test}
```

For debugging purposes, the log level can be set as addition to the `tool` option. The default
value is `:error`. To set the log level to `:debug` you use this line in your `mix.exs` file:

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: Coverex.Task, log: :debug]
```

The usual log levels of the `Logger` application of Elixir are available.

If you set the flag `coveralls: true` and you are running on `travis-ci`, the coverage information are sent to http://coveralls.io . An example configuration would be

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: Coverex.Task, coveralls: true]
```

Since `coverex 1.4.7`, a summary on the module level is printed on the console. You can switch this off by setting the option `console_log` to `false`.

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: Coverex.Task, console_log: false]
```

If you want to ignore some of the modules to appear in the coverage reports, e.g
because they are generated automatically and therefore often needs no test coverage,
you can do this since `coverex 1.4.8`. Use the option `ignore_modules` and assign
to it a list of module names to ignore.

```elixir
test_coverage: [tool: Coverex.Task, ignore_modules: [Database, Database.User]]
```

Since `coverex 1.4.10` the from the Elixir compiler automatically generated
functions `__info__` and `__struct__` are removed from the list of covered
functions. It simply makes no sense to include them into the list (see also #24).

## Running Coverex

If you have configured Coverex as described above you can run Coverex as a drop-in replacement
for the regular coverage mechanism of mix:

    $> mix test --cover

The coverage reports are found in the `cover` directory or what you have configured as coverage directory
as explained in the docs of the `Mix.Tasks.Test` task.
